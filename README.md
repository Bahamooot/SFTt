PROCEDURAL GENERATON FOR TOPIC 1 OF APC

Executable has only been tested on Mac and i have no idea how to run it on windows.

After hours of not being able to get it to work i give up.

Props to the people on stack overflow who gave me the first google search they could find that was unrelated to my problem and then called me stupid.

You can find a demonstration and explanation of how the code works at this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYPlU2CTq6c
